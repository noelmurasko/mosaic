# mosaic
An [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io "Asymptote: The Vector Graphics Language") module for drawing substitution tilings.

To use the mosaic examples, and use mosaic in your own code, first add the path to the mosaic directory to the ASYMPTOTE_DIR environment variable (see Section 2.5 of the Asymptote documentation for more information about Asymptote search paths).
