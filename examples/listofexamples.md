# List of examples in mosaic
As of May 11, 2024.

- AmmanBeenker.asy
- boxRect.asy
  - A made-up tiling used to develop mosaic.
- chair.asy
- chairDot.asy
  - A modification of chair.asy, which uses the decoration/layer features of mosaic.
- chairlabel.asy
  - A modification of chair.asy, which uses the letter L (created from a Label) as a tile.
- chairaxialshade.asy
  - A modification of chair.asy, which uses the axial shading features of mosaic.
- chairradialshade.asy
  - A modification of chair.asy, which uses the radial shading features of mosaic.
- chairrand.asy
  - A modification of chair.asy, in which it is random whether or not a tile is iterated.
- domino.asy
- fudgeflake.asy
- Hilbertcurve.asy
  - Hilbert curve, using substitution (see https://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/hilbert-curve/).
- KenyonNonFLC.asy
  - Keynon's non FLC tiling which is not of finite local complexity (see https://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/kenyons-non-flc/).
- PenroseKite.asy
- PenroseKiteMatching.asy
  - A modification of PenroseKite.asy that shows a matching rule.
- PenroseRhomb.asy
- PenroseRhombMatching.asy
  - A modification of PenroseRhomb.asy that shows a matching rule.
- periodDoubling.asy
- pinwheel.asy
  - The epitome of a tiling with statistical circular symmetry.
- pinwheelVariant.asy
  - A periodic variant of the pinwheel tiling.
- pinwheelrand.asy
  - Each iteration randomly chooses between the aperiodic and periodic pinwheel substitution rule.
- SierpinskiGasket.asy
- square.asy
- tromino1.asy
  - A variation of the chair tiling using trominos (see https://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/tromino1/).
